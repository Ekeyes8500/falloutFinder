# INTRODUCTION

Thanks for using the Fallout Finder! 

This is a little different than the typical "Friend Finder" app: basically this presents you with a series of statements and you choose how much you agree/disagree with said statement. This checks your answers against probable answers from characters from the video game Fallout 4 and lets you know which one you would be most compatible traveling together!

# FEATURES

* Calls character data from an API, currently set up to route any potential posts to it (Future plan)
